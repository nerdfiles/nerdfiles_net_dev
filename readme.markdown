Let's call it something like "the living journal." The basic idea was tossed about in "The Weedy Florilegium." 

Basically, it is a hypermedia web application which presents a simple "page" analogy to the media device. Any object that the owner (agent) of the page touches may be repesented by an API that exists on the web. Any consumer (agent) that touches the page in some determinate way may invoke an opportunistic API that has potential.

  e.g.  "Hey (Face.com API), 
        look (handwriting app) 
        at (Geolocation API connecting timecreated and timepresented) 
        what (webapp multiply realizable across a range of media devices supporting or not supporting media queries, which also sends out an RSS or check-ins one in if it is in reasonable, or say "conversational," proximity of a shoppe [IFTTT, Google Maps, Twitter, etc.]) 
        I just drew!"

The webpage presented is a simple lined-paper presentation. With simple or organic animation, thumbnails may be presented along a character of meme structures, within certain logical regions of the page. Primary presentation is single-page, infinite scroll. 

If a user clicks on anything, even the page itself, a feedback (recursive callback) system should exist to, along privacy settings (CLAIMS <-> MODIFY; LIBERTIES <-> READ >> .responsibility), train the artificial neural network for selection of multiply realizable meme structures (media device as a mode of perception) instantiated over the brain of that system and neighboring systems.
